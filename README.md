# Techno Treatment: Industrial Wastewater Recovery 💧
**An Arduino-controlled filtration system for marble-factory wastewater.**

### 📌 Project Overview
Industrial wastewater from marble factories is a major pollutant in Egypt. This project designed a three-stage system to treat this water for reuse in car-washing and irrigation.

### 🔬 Technical Process
1. **Chemical Treatment:** Decanoic acid dissolved in ethanol is added to water. An **Arduino system** controls solar heat ($40^\circ\text{C}-80^\circ\text{C}$) to precipitate salts.
2. **Physical Treatment:** Activated carbon removes color and odors.
3. **Neutralization:** Sodium bicarbonate ($NaHCO_3$) is used to raise the pH from 6.5 to a neutral 7.23.

### 📊 Results & Analysis
- **TDS Reduction:** From **550 ppm to 55 ppm** (90% efficiency).
- **Conductivity:** Reduced from 1100 ds/m to 110.
- **Sustainability:** Uses renewable solar energy and low-cost materials.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Hardware:** Arduino (Temperature control), Concave Mirrors (Solar concentration).
- **Chemistry:** Decanoic Acid, Ethanol, Activated Carbon.
